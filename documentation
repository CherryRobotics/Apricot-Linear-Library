/**
This is the Apricot linear algebra class.
it contains classes and functions for doing linear algebra
including matrix and vector operations.

I've made it so,
apricotVector will represent columns.
as such,
          ApricotVector([x,y,z])
is equivalent to
                  |x|
                  |y|
                  |z|


and ApricotMatrix will handle the implementation of columns.

ApricotMatrix(ApricotVector([x,y,z]), ApricotVector([x1,y1,z1]), ApricotVector([x2,y2,z2]));

is equivalent to

                 |x   x1   x2|
                 |y   y1   y2|
                 |z   z1   z2|
